# Martlet Fund — Quantitative Team

## Overview
The Martlet Fund at McGill is a student-led investment fund combining rigorous financial research with data-driven strategies. The Quantitative Team focuses on quantitative research, data infrastructure, systematic strategy development, and execution to drive the Fund’s performance and innovation.

## Mission
- Research: Build, test, and validate reproducible quantitative investment models.
- Infrastructure: Create scalable data pipelines, backtesting frameworks, and tooling to support automated strategies.
- Education & Growth: Mentor members in quantitative finance, data science, and software engineering through hands-on projects.

## What We Do
- Strategy research: factor models, alpha signals, ML approaches, and portfolio construction.
- Backtesting & validation: realistic backtests with transaction costs, slippage, market impact, and walk‑forward / OOS validation.
- Data engineering: ingest, clean, version, and maintain price, fundamentals, and alternative datasets.
- Execution & risk analytics: prototype execution algorithms, simulate market impact, and build exposure/turnover/drawdown tools.
- Production deployment: convert research to production pipelines with monitoring, alerts, and reporting.

## Research Themes & Projects
Common exploration areas:
- Equity factor models (value, momentum, quality, low-vol)
- Event-driven and earnings-based signals
- Statistical arbitrage and pair trading
- Portfolio optimization (risk-parity, mean-variance, CVaR)
- Alternative data (sentiment, web trends, thematic signals)
